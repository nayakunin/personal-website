I am glad to have an opportunity to introduce myself as part of this application. My name is Elizaveta Kozlova and I moved to Germany 2 years ago due to a situation in russia. I got bachelor’s degree in Applied Mathematics HSE (top 126th worldwide 2021) and finished frontend development bootcamp by Yandex.Prakticum (russian Google). Then later I got a job in VTB’s subsidiary (top 2 russian bank). There I improved my engineering skills and gained valuable experience. Also, I learned to solve issues by myself and take an active part in work process discussions. 

Your job position caught my attention because I find it interesting and exciting to participate in providing your environment with clear air. I think it is important to look for more eco-friendly alternatives to current practices. After living in Moscow and visiting Belgrade I felt how terrible air pollution is. I believe that more companies will be able to switch to eco-friendly technologies with accessible and easy to use service. 

I sincerely ask you to try me for this position.
