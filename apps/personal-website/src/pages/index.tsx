At Delivery Hero, my role spanned a wide spectrum of frontend and backend
responsibilities:

- Managed the deprecation of a legacy PHP backoffice from the frontend side.
- Pioneered the development of a new React micro frontend.
- Engaged closely with backend engineers from multiple teams to synchronize APIs.
- Operated under a stringent deadline, ensuring the timely deployment of the project.
- Concurrently developed multiple features, utilizing feature flags and the proposed
  API. This strategic approach bolstered the development pace, keeping me largely
  unblocked throughout the project.
- Integrated localization into the micro frontend using react-i18n.
- Leveraged GH actions for global deployment, both configurations handled by me.
- Transitioned from Material UI to an adaptable internal design system for the vendor
management team.
- Established a new design system layered atop our internal platform, leading the
multi-team transition to this system.
- Spearheaded the integration of internationalization for the vendor management team.
- Contributed actively to the design system team's codebase and collaborated on the
  creation of functional yet extendable components.
- Facilitated smooth migration to the new design system across different teams.

This role underscored my versatility, allowing me to seamlessly pivot between frontend
and backend tasks as required, and my commitment to meeting deadlines without
compromising on quality.
