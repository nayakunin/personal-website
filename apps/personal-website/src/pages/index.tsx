          <p>
            At Delivery Hero, my role spanned a wide spectrum of frontend and backend
            responsibilities:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Managed the deprecation of a legacy PHP backoffice from the frontend side.</li>
            <li>Pioneered the development of a new React micro frontend.</li>
            <li>
              Engaged closely with backend engineers from multiple teams to synchronize APIs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Operated under a stringent deadline, ensuring the timely deployment of the project.
            </li>
            <li>
              Concurrently developed multiple features, utilizing feature flags and the proposed
              API. This strategic approach bolstered the development pace, keeping me largely
              unblocked throughout the project.
            </li>
            <li>Integrated localization into the micro frontend using react-i18n.</li>
            <li>
              Leveraged GH actions for global deployment, both configurations handled by me.
            </li>
            <li>
              Transitioned from Material UI to an adaptable internal design system for the vendor
              management team.
            </li>
            <li>
              Established a new design system layered atop our internal platform, leading the
              multi-team transition to this system.
            </li>
            <li>
              Spearheaded the integration of internationalization for the vendor management team.
            </li>
            <li>
              Contributed actively to the design system team&apos;s codebase and collaborated on
              the creation of functional yet extendable components.
            </li>
            <li>Facilitated smooth migration to the new design system across different teams.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This role underscored my versatility, allowing me to seamlessly pivot between frontend
            and backend tasks as required, and my commitment to meeting deadlines without
            compromising on quality.
