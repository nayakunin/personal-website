          <p>
            Managed the deprecation of a legacy PHP backoffice from the FE side. Created a new React
            micro frontend. Worked closely with BE engineers from several teams to align the APIs.
            The project had a tight deadline, but we managed to deploy it in time. I was able to
            work on several features at the time, deploying them under feature flags using the
            proposed API. This significantly improved the overall pace of development because I
            managed to stay unblocked for almost the whole time. The developed MFE is localized
            using react-i18n and deployed globally using GH actions. Both I configured myself.
